# MazeRunner
A tower defense game, where you really have to create mazes with dead ends. 
The creatures search their way through the maze wave by wave, splitting up at crossings. 
But beware: they talk to each other and thus will be informed about the dead ends soon. 
Your only hope is to build towers ontop of the walls and continuously upgrade them to allways deadlier weapons

This game is a project for the Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich.
